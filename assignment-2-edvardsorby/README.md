# Domain description

This repo contains an Ecore model for an E-Commerce web application. As further elaborated in Assignment 1, the main parts of this domain includes the Marketplace itself, Item listings, Categories and Users of the application. Variability aspects that have been modeled are the Role of the users, which can lead to varying levels of privileges in the application, the Categories that are available, and the Language of the application.
